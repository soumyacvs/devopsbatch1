We have a path provided by gitops team where we can use /plan and /apply to commit the changes into remote repository

To create a pull request through VSC

git clone "repository path link"
git cd enter into proj resources 
git checkout -b <create a new branch>
after making the changes 
git add .
  git status 
  git commit -m "feat: <branch name> added jenkinsfile"
  git push origin <new branchname>
